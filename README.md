Sports Activity tools for MSDN Magazine article
===============================================

This repository is intended for readers of our article on MSDN Magazine, sports
and data scientists, working with sensor data from sensors such as the open
source Sensor Kit and others. The repository contains:

-   [SensorKit SDK](https://github.com/CatalystCode/SportsActivity/tree/master/SensorKit/src), a library which contains many useful functions from Bluetooth
    connectivity with the sensors, to simple data models for turn and jump
    detection, as well as connectivity with Microsoft Cosmos DB and Azure cloud
    containers.

-   R scripts for [turn detection](https://github.com/CatalystCode/SportsActivity/tree/master/ClassifyingActivities) and [parsing sensor data](https://github.com/CatalystCode/SportsActivity/tree/master/DataPrep).

-   Python scripts of calculating [G-force and load](https://github.com/CatalystCode/SportsActivity/tree/master/Gforce).

-   Sample [data files](https://github.com/CatalystCode/SportsActivity/tree/master/SourceData).
